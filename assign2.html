    <p>Ratatouille is a film that is based around a rat who wants to become a chef. The only problem is that he is a rat and in kitchens is considered bad and should be killed. Remy the rat firsts starts off in the roof of a little house somewhere in France and live with his colony of rats. His Dad is the chief of the rats and they both have different views on the world. His Dad thinks that he should stay with rats but then Remy wants to be a chef and do something. When Remy explores the kitchen he wakes up the old lady who lives there and she basically breaks the place and they all move down the sewers but Remy gets lost and left behind. Eventually he ends up in a part of the sewer all by himself. He talks to this imaginary figure called Gusteau (he does exist he is dead). Remy is a big fan of Gusteau and was devastated when he found out he was dead. The figure of Gusteau tells Remy to go up to the surface and he does. It turns out that he had been under Paris the whole time. Remy could see Gusteau’s old restaurant and ran over the roofs to it. There Remy see the kitchen and really wants to start to cook. A new person arrives called ‘Linguini’ he is a garbage boy. He ends up knocking over a soup and tries to fix it. At this point Remy sees it and fixes it this is where he is caught by Linguini and then the head chef tells him to kill it outside. Linguini does not kill it and take Remy home. This is where Remy starts to cook. Remy is hidden inside of Linguini’s hat and controls him by pulling his hair. Remy is finally cooking. Later because of Linguini’s success the head chef invite him into his office because he thinks he has a rat. They get drunk and eventually Linguini is left at the restaurant. A few scenes later Remy sneaks into the office to find a letter saying the Linguini is Gusteau’s son. Remy escapes with the papers showing it to Linguini and then Linguini takes over the restaurant. This is when Linguini starts to get Gusteau’s back on track and moves out into a new house. All of this thanks to Remy. The evil food critic Ego hears about Gusteau’s and goes there to critique the food. This is where Linguini decides to tell his crew about Remy controlling him. They all leave and he is left to manage on his own. Then Remy calls his entire colony to help cook the food with the help of Linguini and Colette. They give Ego ‘Ratatouille’ and he eats it along with the previous owner of the restaurant and he is taken back to his childhood. He loves the food. He is made to wait until all customers are gone before he is shown the cook. The Linguini shows him and he says thanks and walks off. The restaurant got shutdown because of the health inspector but they set up a new restaurant and Remy get to be the chef. Ego always visits the restaurants and loves it.
